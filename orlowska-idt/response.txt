We thank the referee for the detailed comments.

We have taken almost everything into account so here we just list the
things that we did *not* do.

The referee suggested that we replace "x IN S" with "S x" uniformly to
make the connections between set membership and predicates clearer. We
have not done this as the two are not equivalent in HOL4, although
they are provably equivalent in the sense that one holds iff the
second holds.
